## The Story When Doing This Challenge

I got confused on the `font-weight`. I used `900` on `Order Summary` and `Annual Plan`. For the `Proceed Payment` and `Cancel Order`, I used `700` and the rest used `500`.

For the breakpoint, I only used `320px`, `400px`, and `750px`. First on `320px` breakpoint for the smallest screen width, I made the music icon hidden. On `400px`, I made the `Order Summary` bigger. Lastly, on `750px` I used `pattern-background-desktop.svg`.
